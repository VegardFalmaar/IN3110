# IN3110 Assignment 6

Only tasks 1 and 2 are fully implemented. I have implemented the pop-up boxes
in task 3, but the dropdown menu is not yet finished. It is there, but has no
functionality.

## Code dependencies
The code runs with python 3.6.9. The following packages are used, and the code
runs with the given versions:
- Altair, version 4.1.0
- Pandas, version 1.1.4
- Flask, version 1.1.2

## How to run the code
`web_visualization.py` is the only code file associated with the project. The
Jyputer Notebook has been used for developing the code and is not part of the
final solution. To run the code, simply execute
```
python3 web_visualization.py
```
The website is then ready to be viewed in the browser, likely at
```
http://localhost:5000/
```
This home page contains links to the websites where the different plots can be
viewed.
